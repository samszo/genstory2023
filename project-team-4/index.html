                <b>The dog said 1:</b> In a rural corner of Wisconsin, there I was, a young boy's faithful dog, working alongside him on his family's farm. 
                Though the boy cherished me dearly, his peers often mocked him for his perceived lack of intelligence, and even his parents held disdain for him. 
                Amidst this harsh treatment, my presence was the boy's solace, providing him unwavering companionship.
